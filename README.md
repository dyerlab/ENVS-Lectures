# ENVS-Lectures

Here are the lectures I've written as a part of most courses that I've taught at the [Center for Environmental Studies](https://ces.vcu.edu) as well as for various workshops and other output.  There is a github pages site [here](https://dyerlab.github.io/ENVS-Lectures) listing all the individual topics, as stand-alone (Lecture/Narrative/Homework) items.


If you would like to build this repository locally, you should:

1. Clone it  
2. Open the `BuildAllLectures.R` file and change the variable `firstRun` to `TRUE` so that it will make sure you have all the required libraries installed.
3. Source `BuildAllLectures.R`
4. Open the file `docs/index.html` with a browser.
