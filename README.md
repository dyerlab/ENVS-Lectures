# ENVS-Lectures

Here are the lectures I've written as a part of most courses that I've taught at the [Center for Environmental Studies](https://ces.vcu.edu) as well as for various workshops and other output.  There is a github pages site [here](https://dyerlab.github.io/ENVS-Lectures) listing all the individual topics, as stand-alone (Lecture/Narrative/Homework) items.
