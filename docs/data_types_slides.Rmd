# Variable Assignment

In R, we work algebraically assigning values to variables.  A variable is simply a container within which we store information.

```{r}
x <- 21
x
```


Yes those are .red[two different and connected symbols]  used to assigne the value of 21 to the varialbe `x1`.  

--

In my mind, I see this as:

> The variable `x` is assigned the value of 21.

--

You can also go in the opposite direction

```{r}
42 -> y
y
```

# Numerical Data  





---

# Introspection

In `R`, each variable can be querried about it's `class` (what kind of data that particular variable holds).  The follow

```{r}
x <- 42
class( x )
is.numeric( x )
```

---

# Coercion 

We can also *one representation* of our data into a different class (there are limitations).  For example, if we just read in a text file and it has a represented as text (a [Character Data Type](CharacterData.html) in `R`) but we need to have it function as a `numeric` type, we can use the following convention

```{r}
x <- "42"
class( x )
y <- as.numeric( x )
class(y)
y
```


---

# Vectors of Numbers

We are most commonly confronted with more than one datum point and R has been designed to be able to handle most of its operations on either single values in a variable or for vectors of values.  This is very convenient and speeds up computations considerably.

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,5,6,7)
x
```


---

# Sequences

You can create sequences of values by hooking up the `minimum` and `maximum` value with a colon (in either direction), though they only increment by `1`.

```{r}
x <- 1:9
x
y <- 10:2
y
```

---

# Sequences (again)

For more complicated sequences, we can use the `seq()` function (for *sequence*^[Yes, these R programmers have a great sense of humor]).

```{r}
seq( 18, 42, by=2 )
```

and with floating point numbers (mmmm pi...)

```{r}
seq( pi,4*pi, by=pi/2)
```


---

# Indexing

When we have a vector, we can get and set values within it by indicating which element as an integer *index* (*n.b.,* indices in `R` start with 1 for the first element unlike some other languages \*cough cough Python\*).

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x[3]
x[5] <- 42
x
```


---


# Slicing

We can grab more than one element from a vector by using slices (which is a fancy way of saying that we are using a vector of numbers as an index).

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
x[8:5]
```

---


# Fancy Slicing

Here I use the expression `x %% 2 == 0` which has two new operators in it: 
 - `%%`: The *modulus* operator which returns the remainder after division, and  
 - `==`: The equality operator

```{r}
even <- (x %% 2 == 0)
x[even]
```


---


# Grabbing Random Items


It is not uncommon to take random samples.  Consider the following vector with 5 elements.

```{r}
favorite_number <- sample( 1:10, size = 1 )
favorite_number
```


---

# Random Number**s**

When asking for more than one item, we need to specify if any one of them can be repeatedly sampled.

```{r}
sample( 1:10, size = 2, replace=FALSE )
```

--

```{r}
sample( 1:2, size=10, replace=TRUE )
```

--

We can pull a single random number from it using the `sample()` function:

```{r}
sample( x, size=1 )
```



---

# Numberical Approximations

Computers use binary switches to represent numbers.  For integers, it is great, but for floating point numbers it .red[sucks], big time.  

Consider the following:

```{r}
x <- .1
y <- .3 / 3 
```


But if we ask if they are equal, what do you expect?

--

```{r}
x == y
```

--

```{r}
print(x, digits=20)
print(y, digits=20)
```
