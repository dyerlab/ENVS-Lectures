# Community Input

`R` is designed to be extensible.  This means that as people tackle different problems, they provide code solutions that others may also freely use.

# Data & Narrative

The spatial distribution of $N =$ `r sum(araptus$Males) + sum(araptus$Females)` individuals were sampled from $K =$ `r nrow(araptus)` sampling sites covered the entire known extent for *Araptus attenuatus* (Figure 1).  On average the sex ratio (Females:Males) within each of the sampling locales varied considerably, ranging from a low of `r format(min( araptus$Females / araptus$Males ), digits=3)` to `r format(max( araptus$Females / araptus$Males ), digits=3)`.

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
model <- glm( (Females / Males) ~ log(Suitability), 
              data = araptus,
              family = Gamma() )
```


Female beetles seem to be selecting locales in more suitable habitats (Figure 2), which is consistent with a Gaussian log normal distribution (GLM; intercept = `r format(summary(model)$coefficients[1,1], digits=3)`; coef =`r format(summary(model)$coefficients[2,1], digits=3)`; P =`r format(summary(model)$coefficients[2,4], digits=3)`)..  This suggests that males who establish brood chambers at the margins of the species niche are actively selected against by maturing females.

# Getting R

The canonical location for R is [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), which is the main site but has [mirrors](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) sites located across the world.  

- Pick a site in close geospatial proximity to you.

- Download the installer for your platform (Mac, Windows, Linux)

- Follow the instructions on the installer for your particular platform.

# Sufficent R Version?

If you already have R installed on your computer, you may want to make sure it is up-to-date.  The last time these slides were compiled (they are written in R as well), the version was: 

```{r}
version$version.string
```

To ensure you are able to complete all the activites in this class, please have at least this version on your computer.


---

# Keeping Updated

If you have a relatively recent version, we can make sure that the packages you already have are also updated by giving the following command.

```{r}
update.packages(ask=FALSE)
```
