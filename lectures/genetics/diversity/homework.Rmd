## Overview

In this activity, we will be examining diversity in the Sonoran desert bark beetle, *Araptus attenuatus*, included in the `gstudio` library.

## Activity Questions


1. Create a `leaflet` map showing the levels of effective allelic diversity ($A_e$) as bars by Populations for loci $LTRS$, $WNT$, and $EN$.

2. Estimate effective allelic diversity for all populations of the individuals where *Species == Peninsula* at the locus `MP20`.  Is there the same indication of "Allele Surfing" in the beetle as shown for its host plant?  How do you interpret this pattern?

3. Is there more effective allelic diversity in the `Cape` or `Peninsula` groupings?  

4. Is there a correlation between genetic effective allelic diversity ($A_e$) and genotypic diversity ($H_e$) in these data?  Do you expect there to be one?  Why?
