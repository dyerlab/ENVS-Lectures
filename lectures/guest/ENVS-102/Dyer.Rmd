# ENVS Program



---

# New People, Vision, & Directions

*Historically:* This program was an extension of the BS in Biology.  

--

*Realistically:* An Environmental Scientist is **much more** than a biologist.


---

# Why a BS in Environmenal Studies

The goal of the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree program in Environmental Studies is to provide an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree program that emphasizes the critical links between environmental life sciences and public policy. 

--

This goal necessitates training that crosses disciplinary boundaries. Through a program of study combining **environmental science**, **environmental technology**, and **environmental policy**, the successful graduate will gain a range of skills designed to facilitate a science-based understanding of the natural world and human interactions with it. 

--

The B.S. is specifically designed to provide students with professional training to prepare them for careers in the application of environmental science and policy.



---

# Program-Level Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this program, students will be able to demonstrate the following:  

- Relate the principles and interconnections of environmental science and policy  
- Demonstrate the ability to use basic environmental skills within the research processes  
- Demonstrate a knowledge of basic biological concepts and their integration  
- Demonstrate a knowledge of basic ecological concepts and integration  
- Demonstrate a knowledge of basic earth science concepts and their integration
