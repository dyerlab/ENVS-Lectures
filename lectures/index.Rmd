Below are all the lecture topics that I've developed for various classes taught at the [Center for Environmental Studies](https://ces.vcu.edu).  For more information on these lectures, feel free to contact me directly at [rjdyer@vcu.edu](mailto://rjdyer@vcu.edu).


```{r}
# Define some helper functions
btn <- function(path, color, name, as.nb=FALSE) {
  nb <- ifelse( as.nb, ".nb", "")
  code <- paste( "<a href='", 
                 path, "/",name, nb,
                 ".html' class='w3-button w3-round-small w3-", 
                 color, "'>", Hmisc::capitalize(name),"</a>",
                 sep="")
  return( code )
}

video <- function( path, color, name ) {
  val <- read_file(  paste(path,"video.txt",sep="/") )
  btn <- paste("<a href='",
               val,
               "' class='w3-button w3-round-small w3-",

  buttons <- numeric(0)
  for( path in files ) {
    
    vid <- ifelse( file.exists(  paste(path,"video.txt", sep="/") ),
                   video( path, "amber", "video"), "")
    
    slides <- ifelse( file.exists(  paste(path,"slides.Rmd", sep="/") ),
                      btn(path,"orange","slides"),
                      "")

                          btn(path,"blue","narrative",as.nb = TRUE),

                        btn(path,"indigo","homework", as.nb=TRUE),

```


## The R Language

The following components focus on fundamental aspects of the `R` statistical language and should be applicable to anyone who is working with `R` on a regular basis.

```{r}
files <- list.dirs( path="r_language", recursive=FALSE )
makeTable( files, caption="Content lectures for R language materials.")
```

## Markdown  

Markdown is a tremendously powerful tool for bringing your data, your analyses, and the manner in which you communicate them into tigher collaboration.  Learning markdown will make your life *so* much easier, you will wonder how you got along without it up until now... `r emo::ji("smile")`.

```{r}
files <- list.dirs( path="markdown", recursive=FALSE )
makeTable( files, caption="Merge data, communication, and visualization into a single framework using RMarkdown and numerous extensions thereof.")
```


## Visualizing Data

The ability to visualize data is one of the most fundamental components of data literacy.  The following topics 

```{r}
files <- list.dirs( path="visualization", recursive=FALSE )
makeTable( files, caption="Content lectures for visualizing data in R.")
```


## Data Manipulation

This is where the rubber meets the road in data analysis.  By far, the vast amount of effort we expend in our daily work is getting data into a format that makes sense to us, that can surface various insights, and be inserted into our analysis workflows.  

```{r}
files <- list.dirs( path="manipulation", recursive=FALSE )

makeTable( files, caption="These are methods based upon data manipulation, <i>sensu lato</i>.")
```


## Spatial Data

Here are some lectures that focus on spatial data components and how to manipulate it and extract components from it.

```{r}
files <- list.dirs( path="spatial", recursive=FALSE )
makeTable( files, caption="Content lectures for working with geospatially referenced data (points, lines, polygons, and rasters) in R.")
```


## Statistical Models

Once we get the data and configure it properly, we can test specific hypotheses by the application of statistical models.

```{r}
files <- list.dirs( path="models", recursive=FALSE )
makeTable( files, caption="A broad collection of general statiatical models as applied to data in R.")
```

## Landscape 

Here are some lectures that mix together some of the above activities that I've developed to teach a graduate and postgraduate workshop in *Landscape Genetics* based upon habitat analyses.

```{r}
files <- list.dirs( path="landscape", recursive=FALSE )
makeTable( files, caption="A series of lectures and activities focused on the spatial analysis of landscape genetic structure in R.")
```


## Genetics

Here are some lectures on content that I've created to work with genetic data.

```{r}
files <- list.dirs( path="genetics", recursive=FALSE )
makeTable( files, caption="A series of lectures and activities focused on the spatial analysis of landscape genetic structure in R.")
```


## Emergency AWS Canvas Down I CANNOT FIND MY CONTENT FOR FINALS!!!!

Because of the ongoing AWS problems, there are intermitent errors using Amazon Web Services that are preventing edits and uploads to content.
