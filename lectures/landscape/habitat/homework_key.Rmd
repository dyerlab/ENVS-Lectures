## Overview




```{r}
library( sf )
library( readr )
library( raster )
library( leaflet ) 
```





```{r message=FALSE}
dogwood_coords <- "https://gitlab.com/ThurstonCounty/landscape-genetics-workshop/-/raw/master/data/DogwoodUrban.csv"


```



1. Create an interactive map to visualize the location of the sample trees on the landscape.  For each of the tree locations, provide a pop-up so you can see the `Mother` identification number.

```{r}
read_csv( dogwood_coords ) %>%
  st_as_sf( coords=c("Longitude","Latitude"), crs=4326 ) %>%
  arrange( Mother ) -> dogwood

dogwood %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers( popup = ~Mother)

```




2. The MRLC data viewer is found [here](https://www.mrlc.gov/viewer/).  Using the coordinates from the focal trees, download the following coverages: Tree Canopy, Land Cover, & Impervious Services.
