## Overview

This activity will focus on working with simple networks.  You will need the following data sets.

```{r}
library( gstudio ) 
library( popgraph )
data(arapat)
data(lopho)
data(baja)
```



1. Create a *de novo* network based upon a hypothesized population model for your own organism and study site.  Parameterize the nodes with locations and names and visualize it both a-spatially and spatially projected onto a map.

2. Estimate a population graph for the *arapat* data set and visualize it in a `leaflet()` map. 

3. Estimate from the *arapat* population graph node-specific parameters such as degree, centrality, and betweenness.  Load in the previous sex-baised dispersal data sets.  Is the estimated habitat suitability for each sampling locale correlated with any of these graph-theoretic parameters?

4. Load in the `lopho` and `upiga` population graphs and map out each of their individual popualtion graphs as well as the `congruence_topology`.  What kind of inferences can you gain by looking at these levels of spatial synchrony?
