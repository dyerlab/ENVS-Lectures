# Networks as a Metaphor

Much of what we do in Landscape (and Popualation) Genetics can be considered as a set of network problems.  

Both genetic and ecological distances are commonly represented as distance matrices, which mathematically is also an adjacency matrix.

  - Between Sites connectivity $\to$  gene flow.  
  
  - Between Site separation $\to$ spatial/ecological separation.  
  
  - Source/Sink dynamics

# Topological Rules - Graph Metrics

Perhaps these networks are defined by graph-construction algorithms, many of which have been sucessful in describing other network structures (internet, epidemoloigcal disease networks, etc.)  In these models, the topological connections define the network connection rules.

# Challenges to Rules-Based Networks

Rules based networks require `someone` to decide on the rules.


- Male intuition?   

- "Body of Knowledge"...

--

Making .redinline[arbitrary] decisions about modifying your data based upon your own *intuition* or *body of knowledge* is suspect.  

- No matter what kind of *expert* you think you are in some system (with fancy papers to show off), your intuition is just a **guess**, nothing more.

- Use **data**, **math**, and **experimentation** to verify the input into your models.

To what extent doe the .redinline[mechanisms that influence realized connectivity for a species] sampled among different locations operate in a way that is aligned with a fancy graph-construction algorithm thought up by some mathematician?

# Non-Uniqueness of Structure

A structure statistic such as $F_{ST}$ is a very powerful tool for understanding  connectivity.  However, there are some topological concerns related to its non-reversability.

# Connectivity & Intervening Habitat

If the network captures much of the underlying connectivity network, then the habitat types that connectivity edges traverse may be indicative of preferendes in paths of gene flow.  One way to test this while at the same time preserve any local habitat heterogeneity is to permute the edges.

$H_O: Edges \; Random \; WRT \; Habitat$

If this is true, then we should be able to permute edges across the landscape and `raster::extract()` the habitat types traversed.  The set of observed ones should be just a random sample of the randomized ones **if and only if** the null hypothesis is correct.

See the function `?randomize_graph()` on how you can randomize the edges in a network.

# Topological Properties

There are several different statistics measuring properties of nodes and edges.  Here are some examples:  

- *Degree:* The number of edges connected to a node.  

- *Closeness:* Standardized distance from a node to other nodes (firestation).

- *Betweenness:* Standardized distance from everywhere else to the node/edge (library).
