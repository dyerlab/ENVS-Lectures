# Impetus

It is our .redinline[goal] to identify which features of the landscape influence movement of genes or organisms.  The challenge is that we can't just ask them...  

So, we must examine a wide range of potential features that may influence connectivity and evalute the extent to which they satisfy the canonical landscape genetics formula.  The challenge is that we do not know **anything** about what the transport agent is keying in on as it moves across the landscape.


- What features are important?

- How much to they influence movement?

- At what scale do organisms detect ecological features?

- How do they decide to move from one locale to the next?

# Two Challenges of Resistance Models 


1. Quantifying **.redinline[what]** and **.redinline[to what extent]** contributes to resistence.   

2. Estimating Separation



---

# Resistance

Resistance can be defined in at least two different ways.

1. *Absolute resistance:* The value of a particular location is constant no matter where you look at it from.  

2. *Relative Resistance:* The value of a particular location depends upon the location being considered.


---

# Absolute Resistance

The resistance surface is fixed as a singular matrix of values.



![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51192827045_d405106ab0_c_d.jpg)


---

# Cost To Cross

The values in the cells represent a *cost* that an organism or gamete or zygote incurs based to traverse it.

- Specific values may be assigned to represent features of the landscape.

- Can represent categorical (e.g, $Forst=1$ or $!Forest = 2$) or continuous values for features based upon local conditions (e.g., $Forest = \delta_{stems}$).

# Granularity

At what scale does the transport agent .redinline[perceive] the environment?


- Forest openings are not a problem until they become so large that they incur a thermal load on insect pollinators.

- A river is not a problem until it gets over 2m deep or has a flow of over 4m/s.


&nbsp;

--

The challenge here, as with all the other stuff, is that we do not know *a priori*, what is important to the transport agent.

# Univariate Resistance Surfaces

To create a resistance raster, we are really working on an exercies in determining what the .redinline[*relevant resistance*] of a particular feature is on the landscape.  Consider the case where we have a landscape with 2 features *A* and *B*.

- *A* is **despised** so $R_A >> R_B$ or $\frac{R_A}{R_B} >> 1$.

--

- *A* is **avoided** so $R_A > R_B$ or $\frac{R_A}{R_B} > 1$.

--

- *A* and *B* are not perceived deferentially by the organism,  or $\frac{R_A}{R_B} == 1$.

--

- *A* is **preferred** so $R_A < R_B$ or $\frac{R_A}{R_B} < 1$.

--

- *A* is **loved** so $R_A << R_B$ or $\frac{R_A}{R_B} << 1$.


---

# Resistance Ratios

I always think of these are a ratio of *in:out*, across a range such as:

$\frac{1}{100}, \frac{1}{50}, \frac{1}{20}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{1}, \frac{5}{1}, \frac{10}{1}, \frac{20}{1}, \frac{50}{1}, \frac{100}{1}$
