This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook and contains the activities associated with analyzing genetic structure and distances.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library( tidyverse )
library( DiagrammeR )
knitr::opts_chunk$set( echo = TRUE,
                       fig.align = 'center')
ggplot2::theme_set( theme_bw() )
```


## The Data

For this activity, you will be using the following data.  These data are provided online and can be downloaded by executing the code in the following chunck. By default, I set the options on this chunk to `eval=FALSE` so it does not hit my servers every time you save this document.

```{r}
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/Araptus_Disperal_Bias.csv"
data <- read_csv( data_url)
summary( data )
```



## Reseach Objective

The fundamental research of this section focuses on `{INSERT OVERALL OBJECTIVE HERE}`.  There are several incremental steps that we need to execute so that we have the proper set of data to answer the overall question.

```{r echo=FALSE}
mermaid("graph LR; A(Process 1)-->B(Process 2);B-->C(Analysis);C-->D(Visualization);D-->E(QA/QC);", width="100%",height="100%")
```

### Data Process 1: `{Name}`

**Necessity:**  The first thing we need to do is locate and get the data into `R` from whatever centralized repository^[You are using a centralized repository for holdling just one copy of your data, right?  If not, you are doing it wrong and risk loss of data integrity.  You can use Github, Box, Google Drive, or whatever just **do not** put it on your laptop harddrive and expect it to be there forever.].  By default, much of the data we work with should be hosted in ASCII format so that in the future, no matter where you are or who you are collaborating with, you will be able to get these data and use them.

**Approach:**  To accomplish this task, we are going to use the `tidyverse` and `gstudio` functions created specifically to import data from external repositories, then check it to make sure there are no errors.

1. Identify URL for repository    
2. Download as a raw file  
3. Translate over genotypes columns  
4. Check for obvious errors in ploidy, coding, and/or missing data.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
mermaid("graph LR;
    A(Identify Repository)-->B(Download Data);
    B-->C[Format Genotypes];
    C-->D{Check For Errors};
    D-->|None| E(Continue);
    D-->|Yep| F(Fix Errors);
    F --> G(Reload to Repository);
    G --> B
    style E fill:#ddffd9
    style F fill:#ffd5cf", width="100%",height="100%")
```


**Implementation:** In the space below implement the workflow outlined above so that you have a working set of data as a `tibble` so we can go to the next step.

```{r}
