# ‚öôÔ∏è Making Functions

A function is just a *chunk* of code, wrapped within curly brakets, and given a name.


```{r eval=FALSE}

foo <- function() {
  
  # R CODE GOES HERE
  
}

```


--

The contents of a function may be:  

- A few lines of code or hundreds,  

- Calls to other functions,  

- Accepting variables as argument *input* (or not), and 

- Returning some object (or not).


---

# Variable Scope

Variables within a function are 'localized' to within that variable *alone*.  This allows us to:

1. Not run out of variable names (`df` and `x` are common ones we've used thus far).  

2. Not have the variables we are working with being clobbered every time we call another function.


---

Define a function with a variable `x` inside the function.

```{r}
foo <- function() {
  x <- 42
  cat("x = ", x, "within function.\n")
}
```


--

Then examine a similarly named variable with a different assigned value before and after calling that function.

```{r}
x <- 23
cat("x = ", x, "before function call.")
```

--

Within the function, the variable represents the value inside the function.

```{r}
foo()
```

--

And after the function is called, examine the value of the variable.

```{r}
cat("x = ", x, "after function call")
```



.blueinline[NOTICE: before and after function are in "global variable scope, whereas inside the function, the variable is localized within the boundaries of the function itself."]


---

# Variable Scope

The global scope is shown in RStudio on the *Environment* tab.

.center[![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50398760012_a53e2ea83d_c_d.jpg)]

--

You can also see what is in the environment by asking to list all variables and functions using the `ls()` function.

```{r}
ls()
```



---

# Passing Varibles to A Function

While some functions do not take input variables, many require it.  To pass variables into the function scope, we identify them in the 


```{r}
foo <- function( x ) {
  cat("x =", x, "in the function.")
}
foo( 23 )
```

--

If you do not provide a value for a required variable, it will give you an error.

```{r error=TRUE}
foo()
```


---

# Default Function Variables

We can put in *default* values for arguments by assigning values in the function parentheses.

```{r}
favorite <- function( professor = "Dyer" ) {
  cat("My favorite professor is:", professor, "\n")
}

favorite()
```

---

# Getting Results from Functions

In addition to sending data *to* a function, we often want to get something *back from* a function.  We **must** be explicit about wanting to send something back to the caller using the `return()` function.

```{r}
foo <- function( name = "Alice") {
  response <- paste( name, "is in the house.")
  return( response )
}
```

--

Then we can assign the results of that function to a variable.

```{r}
who_is_in_the_house <- foo()
who_is_in_the_house
```

# .orange[Conditional Execution]

### .fancy[IF this ELSE that]

---

# Is it Cold Outside üå°

It is very convenient to be able to execute come code under certain conditions and another set of code under other conditions.  

```{r}
freezing <- function( temperature ) {
  if( temperature <= 0 ) {
    print("Brrr")
  } 
  else {
    print("Warm!")
  }
}
```

--

```{r}
freezing( -2 )
freezing( 18 )
```



---

# Multipart Conditionals

Many times we may have to make decisions that have several alternative and exclusive conditions.  We can extend the `IF/ELSE` pattern into an `IF/ELSE IF/ELSE IF/ELSE` pattern of arbitrary length.

```{r}
grade <- function( percentage ) {
  if( percentage >= 90 ) {
    return( "A" )
  } 
  else if( percentage >= 80 ) {
    return( "B" )
  }
  else if( percentage >= 70 ) {
    return( "C" )
  }
  else if( percentage >= 60 ) {
    return( "D" )
  }
  else {
    return( "F" )
  }
}
```

---

# Mutipart Conditional (cont.)

```{r}
grade( 80 )
grade( 93 )
grade( 54 )
```

---

# A Shortcut

There are so many cases where we use the dichotomous `if/else` workflow, that we can simplify this code

```{r eval=FALSE }
if( condition ) {
  TRUE_CONDITION
} 
else {
  FALSE_CONDITION
}
```

--

Can be simplifed into 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ifelse( CONDITION, TRUE_CONDITION, FALSE_CONDITION )
```


---

# An Example

Here is a relevant exmaple from the most recent homework.

```{r}
hour <- sample(0:23, 
               size = 18,
               replace = TRUE)
hour
```

--

```{r}
Day_Or_Night <- ifelse( hour >= 7 & hour <=19, "Day", "Night")
Day_Or_Night

# .green[Looping] ‚ûø

# Looping 

There are times when it is very helpful if we can loop over a collection of things.  These may be elements in a `vector`, rows in a `data.frame`, cycling through files on your computer to load in different data components, or to manipulate and analyze tweets harvested from the internet.

--

&nbsp;

**Use Case:** Determine which values are odd using the modulus operator `%%`  

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 5, 7)
x[1] %% 2 == 0
x[2] %% 2 == 0
x[3] %% 2 == 0
x[4] %% 2 == 0
```

]

.pull-right[
Notice how the index used on `x` is simply a number that is incremented by `1` for each successive entry.  

> It sure would be nice if there were **some** method to do this automatically.

]





---

# The `for` Loop

The for loop is a function that iterates across items.  These can be sequences such as `1:10` or as enumerated items in a vector.


```{r}
for( i in 1:4) {
  cat(i, x[i] %% 2 == 0, "\n")
}
```

--

&nbsp;

.red[Notice: index variable `i` changes each time through the loop!]


---

# The `for` Loop

The for loop is a function that iterates across items.  These can be sequences such as `1:10` or as enumerated items in a vector.


```{r}
for( item in x) {
  cat(item, item %% 2 == 0, "\n")
}
```

--

&nbsp;

.red[Notice: the value passed is the actual item in the vector!]












---

# Applying Functions to Values

Sometimes it helps to apply a single function to each element in a vector.  This is the basis for what we call $functional \; programming$, a kind of approach to working with objects that `R` supports.

--

```{r}
is_even <- function( x ) { return(x %% 2 == 0) }

lapply(x, is_even )
```

---

# Simplifying the `lapply` Function

The output from `lapply()` is a list, whose length is the same as that of the original data.  However, it is sometimes necessary to just get back a vector of values for the results instead of futzing around with a list.<sup>1</sup>.footnote[<sup>1</sup>.small[`lapply(x,FUN,simplify=TRUE)`]]

```{r}
sapply( x, is_even )
```

--

You can also define the function right in the call itself.  Here is an example for finding odd values.

```{r}
sapply( x, function( x ) { return( x %% 2 == 1) } )
```



---

# Mapping a Function

There are some other ways to do the same kinds of operations that are a bit more verbose.

# Reduce 

This allows us to use some function to accumulate the values of elements along a vector.

.pull-left[![Reduce operations](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50953791807_0685201446_o_d.png)]
.pull-right[
```{r}
my_func <- function( x, y ) { return( x + y ) }
Reduce(my_func, x, init=10 )
```

Can check it like this: 

```{r}
sum( x ) + 10
```

# A Non-Trivial Example

Problem: Load all the Baja GEOTiff files in the data directory and then go through them and crop them to the area where *Araptus attenuatus* is found and save them locally as an R object.

--

### Process

1) Find the Data Directory

2) Iterate through the files.  

3) Determine if each file is a GEOTiff  

4) Process each GEOTiff  


---

# Download the Data Directory

For this class (and the other ones that teach using R) I have a bunch of different data sets that we use.  I've made an archive of them and put them on GoogleDrive (~57.3 MB in size).


.pull-left[
- Download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jJUqPaho9TyltAYyGqlwG7G565tQqK5j/view?usp=sharing).

- Open the folder where your R Project is located.

- Put the director of data (appropriately called 'data' in that same folder)

- When you access it, it will be at the *root* of your project directory.
]

--

.pull-right[
Here is my Project Directory with the data file.

---

# Traversing the Filesystem

So, assuming it is downloaded and in place, we can ask your operating system to give us a list of all the files in a particular folder using the `list.files()` function.  At a minimum, you need to give it a starting path to begin the search.

Your .green[Home] directory is .green[~] (`/Users/Rodney` **or** `C:\Users\Rodney`)

```{r}
list.files("~")
```


---

# Other Path Components

The .green[Current] directory is .green[.]

```{r}
list.files( ".")
```

The .green[Parent] directory to the .green[Current] one is .green[../]

```{r}
list.files( "../" )
list.files( "../../" )
```

---

# Subdirectories

The directory for this lecture is 3-levels below the root directory for this 

```{r}
list.files("../../../data/", recursive = TRUE)
```

---

# Pattern Matching

The `list.files` function can also support pattern matching.

```{r}
list.files("../../../data/", recursive = TRUE, pattern = "*.tif")
```

--

And providing the whole path to the file.

```{r}
list.files("../../../data/", recursive = TRUE, pattern = "*.tif", full.names = TRUE)
```

# Back to the Problem

2) Iterate through the files.  

3) Determine if each file is a GEOTiff  

4) Process each GEOTiff - crop & save locally

  st_union() %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 1) %>%
  st_bbox() -> bounds 

bounds 
```

]


---

# Processing Files

Let's step through the process.

```{r}
files <- list.files("../../../data/", 
                    recursive = TRUE, 
                    pattern = "*.tif", 
                    full.names = TRUE)
files
```

Here is the basic code.

```{r}
library( raster )
l <- list() 

for( file in files) {
  r <- raster( file ) 
  r <- crop( r, bounds )
  l[[basename(file)]] <- r
  writeRaster( r, filename = basename( file ), overwrite=TRUE )
}
```

---

# Did it work?

We can see if it worked by looking in the current directory for all *.tif files

```{r}
list.files(".", pattern="tif")
```


--


.pull-left[

&nbsp; 

To delete a file you can use the `unlink()` function but .


```{r}
for( file in files ) { 
  unlink(basename(file)) 
}
list.files(".", pattern="tif")
```

# Putting it All Together.

We can put this all together as a function that loads all the GEOTiff files in a particular directory, crops them and saves them locally.

```{r warning=FALSE}
loadAndCropMyRasterMan <- function( directory, bounds ) {
  
  files <- list.files( path=directory, 
                       pattern = "*tif",
                       full.names = TRUE )
  for( file in files ) { 
    r <- raster( file ) 
    r <- crop( r, bounds )
    writeRaster( r, 
                 filename = basename( file ), 
                 overwrite = TRUE )
    cat("Saved", basename( file ), "\n")
  }
}

loadAndCropMyRasterMan( "../../../data", bounds)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

  unlink(basename(file))
