# Multi-Table Data

Rarely do we keep our data within a single data table.  

.pull-left[ #### Table Structure

Consider the two tables to the right.

- Common column labeled *Key*  

- Other data columns (only 1 in each for brevity)

]

# Varieties of Keys üóù

.pull-left[### Primary Key

A *primary key* is a column in a table that uniquely identifies a single row.  There MUST be a unique identifier to be a *Primary Key*.

```{r}
people <- data.frame( Key = c("A","B","C"),
                      Name = c("Bob","Alice","Mary"),
                      Major = c("ENVS", "ENVS", "BIOL") )
people %>%
  count( Key ) 
```

]

--

.pull-right[ ### Foreign Key

A foreign key is one that references a primary key in *another* table.

```{r}
homework <- data.frame( Key = c("A","B","A","D","B"), 
                        Grade = rpois(5,lambda = 100) )
homework
```

Here the `Key` column is referencing a unique row of data in the `people` data table.

# Taxonomy of Joins

We can combine the data in these tables in several different ways based upon what we are looking for.  When thinking of joins, we must think about the how we want to select the overlapping sets of keys in both data.frames.

- *Full Join* (aka *outer join*)

- *Left Join*  

- *Right Join*  

- *Inner Join*

&nbsp;

The .redinline[*position*] adjective relates to which of the rows are selected for the join and end up in the resutling data table.

---

# Full/Outer Join

The outer join has .redinline[all the data from both left & right tables].  All keys are present in the result.

![Outer Join](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50427993992_4ccede1574_c_d.jpg)




---

# Outer Join

All homework and people data.

```{r}
people %>%
  full_join( homework, by="Key" )
```



---

# Left Join

The left join is one where the result has all the keys from the left but only those in the right one that are in the left.  

![left join](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50427817371_678f0f64c7_c_d.jpg)
--

```{r}
people %>% left_join( homework, by="Key")
```



---

# Right Join

The Right join results in all the keys from the right data table and the matching ones from the left.

]

--

```{r}
people %>% right_join( homework, by="Key")
```


---

# Inner Joins

Inner joins result in the intersection of keys.

![Inner Join](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50427125683_ac44eb1500_c_d.jpg)

```{r}

# .blue[Filtering Joins]

## .fancy[Not combining but refining...]



---

# The Semi Join

We can also use joins to filter values within one `data.frame`.  Here the `semi_join()` keeps everything in the left data that has a key in the right one, but **importantly** it does not import the right data columns into the result.

--

```{r}
people %>% 
  semi_join( homework, by="Key")
```

---

# The Anti Join

The opposite of the `seim_join()` is the `anti_join()` which drops everything in the left table that has a key in the right one, leaving only the ones that are unique.

--

```{r}
people %>%
  anti_join( homework, by = "Key")
```

Four `data.frames` are contained within the library representing all the flights from NYC airports in 2013.
