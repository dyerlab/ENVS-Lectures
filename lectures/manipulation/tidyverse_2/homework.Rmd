## Impetus

This homework focuses on how we can use <tt>tidyverse</tt> routines to become more effective in our pre-treatment of data.  As a removner, the operative *verbs* we use in data preparation include:

- *Select*  
- *Filter*  
- *Mutating*  
- *Arranging* 
- *Grouping*  
- *Summarizing*  

These can be combined in various ways to gain inferences from the raw data.

## The Data

For these questions, we will be using the data set from the [Rice Rivers Center](https://ricerivers.vcu.edu) and is loaded in as raw data from the code below.

```{r message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
library( readr )
library( tidyverse )
library( lubridate )


url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"
rice <- read_csv( url )

summary( rice )
```


## The Questions

Provide your answers as text (e.g., using complete sentences, etc.) and include visual output in tabular or graphical form to support your assertions.  The *key point here* is that **you** need to develop an *evidence-based* narrative to address these questions.

1. On average, is there more rain on Mondays, at daytime, or at night?


```{r}

```





2. What is the overall relationship between salinity and pH?  Does this pattern hold when considering each month individually?


```{r}



```





3. Turbidity is a measurement of the opaqueness of water.  In the rice data, we have a measure of Chlorophyll A in the water.  For estimates where there is more than 200 $Âµg*l^{-1}$, describe the relationship between these two variables.


```{r}


```





4. Show the pattern of tides during the work week that includes Valentines Day in 2004.


```{r}

```





5. Summarize estimates of Wind direction for February.  Pay close attention to what this variable is actually measuring and how you want to display its underlying patterns.


```{r}

```
