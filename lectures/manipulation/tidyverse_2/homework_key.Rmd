## Impetus

This homework focuses on how we can use <tt>tidyverse</tt> routines to become more effective in our pre-treatment of data.  As a removner, the operative *verbs* we use in data preparation include:

- *Select*  
- *Filter*  
- *Mutating*  
- *Arranging* 
- *Grouping*  
- *Summarizing*  

These can be combined in various ways to gain inferences from the raw data.

## The Data

For these questions, we will be using the data set from the [Rice Rivers Center](https://ricerivers.vcu.edu) and is loaded in as raw data from the code below.

```{r message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
library( readr )
library( tidyverse )
library( lubridate )

format <- "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"
read_csv( url ) %>%
  mutate( Date = parse_date_time( DateTime, 
                                  orders=format,
                                  tz="EST") ) %>%
  mutate( Weekday = factor( weekdays( Date ),
                            levels=c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"),
                            ordered=TRUE) ) -> rice 

summary( rice )
```


## The Questions

Provide your answers as text (e.g., using complete sentences, etc.) and include visual output in tabular or graphical form to support your assertions.  The *key point here* is that **you** need to develop an *evidence-based* narrative to address these questions.

1. On average, is there more rain on Mondays, at daytime, or at night?


```{r}
rice %>% 
  filter( Weekday == "Monday") %>%
  mutate( Period = factor( ifelse( hour(Date) < 7, 
                                    "Night", 
                                    ifelse( hour(Date) > 17, 
                                            "Night", 
                                            "Day"))) ) %>%
  group_by( Period ) %>%
  summarise( Rain = mean( Rain_in ) * 2.54,
             SD = sd( Rain_in * 2.54) ) %>%
  knitr::kable( digits=4, caption="Mean and standard deviation of rain on Mondays at the Rice Center.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling( full_width = FALSE)

```





2. What is the overall relationship between salinity and pH?  Does this pattern hold when considering each month individually?

```{r}
rice %>% 
  ggplot( aes(Salinity_ppt, PH) ) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth()
```
So overall, there seems to be a slightly positive relationship at levels. A non-parametric correlation concurs.

```{r}
cor.test( rice$Salinity_ppt, rice$PH, method = "spearman")
```
We can now look at the data by month


```{r}
rice %>% 
  mutate( Month = month(Date,
                        abbr=FALSE,
                        label = TRUE ) ) %>%
  ggplot( aes(Salinity_ppt, PH) ) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth() + 
  facet_grid(Month ~ .)
```

You could grab the correlations as:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
rice %>% 
  mutate( Month = month(Date,
                        abbr=FALSE,
                        label = TRUE ) ) %>%
  group_by( Month ) %>%
  summarize( Correlation = cor.test( Salinity_ppt, PH, method="spearman")$estimate,
             P = cor.test( Salinity_ppt, PH, method="spearman")$p.value ) %>%
  knitr::kable( digits=4, 
                caption="Rank correlation of salinity and pH by month at the Rice Rivers Center.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling( full_width = FALSE)
  
```
And interpret it.




3. Turbidity is a measurement of the opaqueness of water.  In the rice data, we have a measure of Chlorophyll A in the water.  For estimates where there is more than 200 $Âµg*l^{-1}$, describe the relationship between these two variables.


```{r}
rice %>%
  filter( Chla_ugl > 200 ) %>%
  ggplot( aes( Turbidity_ntu, Chla_ugl )) +
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth( col="red", se = FALSE)

```





4. Show the pattern of tides during the work week that includes Valentines Day in 2004.


```{r}
rice %>%
  filter( Date < ymd("2014-02-17"),
          Date >= ymd("2014-02-10")) %>%
  ggplot( aes(Weekday, Depth_m) ) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text( angle = 45,
                                    hjust = 1)) +
  ylab("Water Depth") + 
  xlab("Day of the Week") + 
  ggtitle("Tide depths for the week of Valentines Day")
  

```





5. Summarize estimates of Wind direction for February.  Pay close attention to what this variable is actually measuring and how you want to display its underlying patterns.


```{r}
rice %>%
  ggplot( aes(WindDir) ) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  coord_polar( start=0) + 
  theme_bw()
```
Here I show the histogram density as in polar coordinates.
