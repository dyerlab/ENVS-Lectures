## Impetus

This homework focuses on how we can use <tt>tidyverse</tt> routines to answer the exact same set of questions we addressed in the previous homework.  The operative *verbs* include:

- *Select*  
- *Filter*  
- *Mutating*  
- *Arranging* 
- *Grouping*  
- *Summarizing*  

These can be combined in various ways to gain inferences from the raw data.

Using built-in routines, this amounts to using a lot of logical indices and making intermediate `data.frame` objects.  However, using <tt>tidyverse</tt> foundations, it becomes a much easier process.


## The Data

For these questions, we will be using the data set from the [Rice Rivers Center](https://ricerivers.vcu.edu) and is loaded in as raw data from the code below.

```{r message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
library( readr )
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"
rice <- read_csv( url )
summary( rice )
```


## The Questions

Just like before, we will be answering the same set of questions as before.  However, you should be using tidyverse approaches (pipes and such) to find the answers.  Just like before, you should provide your answers as text (e.g., using complete sentences, etc.) and include visual output in tabular or graphical form to support your assertions.  The *key point here* is that **you** need to develop an *evidence-based* narrative to address these questions.

1. On average, is there more rain during the day on Mondays or at night on Mondays?

```{r}
library( lubridate )

# set up the features for date conversions
format <- "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"
days <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday")

# make a real date
rice$Date <- parse_date_time( rice$DateTime, orders=format, tz="EST")

# make hour so we can do day vs. night
rice$Hour <- hour( rice$Date )

# make weekdays and make them an ordered factor
rice$Weekday <- weekdays( rice$Date )
rice$Weekday <- factor( rice$Weekday, ordered=TRUE, levels = days )

# make months and drop the months that are not in the dataset
rice$Month <- month( rice$Date, label=TRUE, abbr = FALSE )
rice$Month <- droplevels( rice$Month )


mondays <- rice[ rice$Weekday == "Monday", c("Hour", "Rain_in")]

mondays$daytime <- "Day"
mondays$daytime[ mondays$Hour <= 7 ] <- "Night"
mondays$daytime[ mondays$Hour >= 19 ] <- "Night"

df <- data.frame( Period = c("Night","Day"),
                  Total_Rain = c(  sum( mondays$Rain_in[ mondays$daytime == "Night"] ),
                                   sum( mondays$Rain_in[ mondays$daytime == "Day"], na.rm=TRUE ) ),
                  Ave_Rain = c(  mean( mondays$Rain_in[ mondays$daytime == "Night"] ),
                                   mean( mondays$Rain_in[ mondays$daytime == "Day"], na.rm=TRUE ) )
                  )

tbl <- knitr::kable(df, caption="Total and average rain on mondays, in day and nigth (delineated by 7am/7pm).")
kableExtra::kable_minimal( tbl, full_width=FALSE )
```


2. What is the overall trend in salinity and pH?  Does this pattern hold when considering each month individually?


```{r}
ggplot( rice, aes(Salinity_ppt, PH)) + geom_point() 
```



```{r}
ggplot( rice, aes(Salinity_ppt, PH)) + geom_point()  + facet_grid( Month ~ .)
```
or tabular.

```{r}
rice %>% 
  group_by( Month ) %>%
  summarize( Salinity = mean(Salinity_ppt, na.rm=TRUE), 
           PH = mean( PH, na.rm=TRUE ))
```


So it looks like the water gets more saline later in the season.



3. Turbidity is a measurement of the opaqueness of water.  In the rice data, we have a measure of Chlorophyll A in the water.  For estimates where there is more than 200 $Âµg*l^{-1}$, describe the relationship between these two variables.

```{r}
rice[ rice$Chla_ugl > 200, c("Turbidity_ntu", "Chla_ugl") ] -> df 


ggplot( df, aes(Chla_ugl,Turbidity_ntu) ) + 
  geom_point( ) + 
  stat_smooth( method=lm)
  


```

There seems to be a positive realtionship between the two.


4. Show the pattern of tides during the work week that includes Valentines Day in 2004.


```{r}
rice[ rice$Date >= as.Date("2014-02-06") & rice$Date < as.Date("2014-02-13"), c("Date", "Depth_m")] -> df

ggplot( df, aes(Date, Depth_m) ) + geom_point() 
```




5. Summarize estimates of Wind direction for February.  Pay close attention to what this variable is actually measuring and how you want to display its underlying patterns.

```{r}
rice[ rice$Month == "February", "WindDir"] %>%
  ggplot( aes(WindDir) ) + 
   geom_histogram() + 
  coord_polar()
```
