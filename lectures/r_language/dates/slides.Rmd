# Date Objects

When we read a date and/or time object, it is typically given in a textual form:

- February 14, 2021
- Tomorrow @ noon.
- Next Wednesday morning.

But in `R` we need to be able to specify these these textual representations (which mean a lot to us when we read them) into objects that we can perform actual operations on.

# A Larger Data 

The data we will be working with consist of data from the [Rice Rivers Center](https://ricerivers.vcu.edu) which contains water and atmospheric measurements from a stream of sensors in both the James River and on the bluff overlooking the river.

```{r}
library( readr )
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"
rice <- read_csv( url )
names( rice )
```

We are going to focus on the `DateTime` column specifically as these measurements are taken every 15 minutes.

# Raw Data -> Usable Data

Data is often derived from text.

- `read_csv()` must make an estimate of a column data type should be.  

- Estimates are often *least divisive* data type (e.g., `character`).

--

Consider the `DateTime` column in the `rice` data.

```{r}
rice$DateTime[1]
```

--

```{r}
class( rice$DateTime )
```

# Date & Time Challenges

We must consider the following when attempting to conduct *operations* on date and time units.

1. Many different calendars.  

2. Leap days, years, seconds.

3. Time Zones (looking at you Arizona).

4. Non-consistent base units (60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days, 28/29/30/31 days, 12 months, 100 years, 10 centuries)

# The Unix Epoch - Time Zero!

.red[.center[.large[00:00:00 January 1, 1970]]]


Time on computers is kept as the number of seconds since the *epoch*.  It is only .blueinline[displayed] in the Gregorian, Julian, Chinese, Jewish, and other calendars.



```{r}
Sys.time()
```

```{r}
unclass( Sys.time() )
```

# Making Time `r emo::ji("clock")`

To convert something like `r rice$DateTime[1]` from `character` to a `time` object, we need to specify the layout of the elements within the string so the functions know what to operate on.


.pull-left[

- Month as 1 or 2 digits  
- Day as 1 or 2 digits  
- Year as 4 digits  
- a space to separate date from time  
- hour (not 24-hour though)  
- minutes in 2 digits  
- seconds in 2 digits  
- a space to separate time from timezone  
- timezone  
- / separating date objects  
- : separating time objects  

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
rice$DateTime[1]
```


Look at the help file for `?strptime` to see these and other encodings.

```{r}
library( lubridate )
format <- "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"
x <- parse_date_time( rice$DateTime[1], orders=format, tz="EST")
x
```


]

# Making Lots of Time

```{r}
rice$DateTime <- parse_date_time( rice$DateTime,
                                  orders=format,
                                  tz="EST")
summary( rice$DateTime )
```


--

```{r}
rice$DateTime[8199] - rice$DateTime[1]
```


--



```{r}
txt <- paste( "Entry 5000 '", rice$DateTime[5000], "' is julian ordinal day ",yday( rice$DateTime[5000] ), sep="")
txt
```
