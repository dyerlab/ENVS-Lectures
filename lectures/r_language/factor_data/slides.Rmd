# Making Some Categorical Data Types

.left-column[
Unique and individual groupsing that can be applied to a study design.  

- Case sensitive  
- Can be ordinal  
- Typically defined as `character` type
]

.right-column[
```{r}
weekdays <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday",
              "Thursday","Friday","Saturday", 
              "Sunday")
class( weekdays )
weekdays
```

]

# Making Up Some Data 🤷🏻‍

The function `sample()` allows us to take a random sample of elements from a vector of potential values.  


```{r}
chooseOne <- sample( c("Heads","Tails"), size=1 )
chooseOne
```

--

However, if we want a large number items, we can have them with or without replacement.

```{r}
sample( c("Heads","Tails"), size=10, replace=TRUE )
```

---

# Weekdays as example 

We'll pretend we have a bunch of data related to the day of the week.

```{r}
days <- sample( weekdays, size=40, replace=TRUE)
summary( days )
days
```

---

# Turn it into a `factor`

```{r}
data <- factor( days )
is.factor( data )
class( data )
```


---

# Data Type Specific Printing & Summaries


```{r}
data
```

--

```{r}
summary( data )
```

---

# Factor Levels

Each factor variable is defined by the `levels` that constitute the data.  This is a .red[finite] set of unique values

```{r}
levels( data)
```



---

# Factors Ordination

.pull-left[
Examples of conditions where ordination matters:

- Fertilizer Treatments in KG of N<sub>2</sub> per hectare: 10 kg N<sub>2</sub>, 20 N<sub>2</sub>, 30 N<sub>2</sub>, 

- Days of the Week: `Friday` is not followed by `Monday`, 

- Life History Stage: seed, seedling, juvenile, adult, etc.
]

.pull-right[
Examples where Ordination is Irrelevant

- River 

- State or Region

- Sample Location
]


---

# Factor Ordination

If a factor is ordinal, it allows us to use relational comparison operators.

```{r eval=FALSE}
data[1] < data[2]
```
.red[\# Warning message:  ]  
.red[ In Ops.factor(data[1], data[2]) : '<' not meaningful for factors]

--

```{r}
is.ordered(data)
```



---

# Making Ordered Factors

To make them just ordered.

```{r}
data <- factor( days, ordered = TRUE)
is.ordered( data )
```


--


```{r}
data 
```

.red[Problem:] it orders things in *alphabetical* order.



---

# Specifying the Order of Ordinal Factors



```{r}
data <- factor( days, ordered = TRUE, levels = weekdays)
data
```

# The `forcats` library

Part of the `tidyverse` group of packages.

```{r}
library(forcats)
```

This library has a lot of helper functions that make working with factors a bit easier.  I'm going to give you a few examples here but .red[strongly] encourage you to look a the cheat sheet for all the other options.

# Counting Factors

```{r}
fct_count( data )
```


---

# Lumping Factors

```{r}
lumped <- fct_lump_min( data, min = 5)
fct_count(  lumped )
```

---

# Reordering Factors

We can reorder by *appearance order*, *observations*, or *numeric*

*By Frequency*

```{r}
freq <- fct_infreq( data )
levels( freq )
```


*By Order of Appearance*
```{r}
ordered <- fct_inorder( data )
levels( ordered )
```


---

# Reorder Specific Levels

```{r}
newWeek <- fct_relevel( data, "Saturday", "Sunday")
levels( newWeek )
```



---

# Dropping Missing Levels

```{r}
data <- sample( weekdays[1:5], size=40, replace=TRUE )
data <- factor( data, ordered=TRUE, levels = weekdays )
summary( data )
```

--

```{r}
fct_drop( data ) -> dropped

# Fancy Tables

### `knitr` + `table` = `kable` 



---
# Fancy Tables `kable`

We've already learned how to make tables by hand using `---|---` and such, however, it may be important to work with `data.frame` and `tibble` objects and allow them to become nicely presented tables.  

```{r}
library( knitr )
```

The function `knitr::kable()` will take a data frame and output a wide variety of tabular data.  To do this, the essence is that we need to make a data frame whose rows and columns are exactly what we'd like to have translated into markdown and presented.

# Example data `iris`

# Iris


```{r}
head( iris )
```

--

```{r}
summary( iris )
```


---

# Factors and `by()`

One common thing to use factors for is to grab a group of data and perform an operation on them.

**Question: What is mean and variance in sepal length for the three iris species.**

--

The general form of the `by()` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
by( data, index, function)
```


---

```{r}
by( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean ) -> meanLength
meanLength 
```
--

```{r}
by( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, var ) -> varLength 
varLength 
```


---

# Missing Data 

.pull-left[
Missing data is a .red[fact of life] and `R` is very opinionated about how it handles missing values.  In general, missing data is encoded as `NA` and is a valid entry for any data type (character, numeric, logical, factor, etc.).  Where this becomes tricky is when we are doing operations on data that has missing values.  `R` could take two routes:  

1. It could ignore the data and give you the answer directly as if the data were not missing, or  
2. It could let you know that there is missing data and make you do something about it.

Fortunately, `R` took the second route.
]

--

.pull-right[
An example from the iris data, I'm going to add some missing data to it.

```{r}
df <- iris[, 4:5]
df$Petal.Width[ c(2,6,12) ] <- NA
summary( df)
```

Notice how the missing data is denoted in the summary.


]


---

# Missing Data

.pull-left[
### Indications of Missing Data

When we perform a mathematical or statistical operation on data that has missing elements `R` will **always** return NA as the result.

```{r}
mean( df$Petal.Width )
```

This warns you that .red[at least one] of the observations in the data is missing.

Same output for using `by()`, it will put `NA` into each level that has at least one missing value.

```{r}
by( df$Petal.Width, df$Species, mean )
```

]

--

.pull-right[
### Working with Missing Data

To acknowledge that there are missing data and you still want the values, you need to tell the function you are using that data is missing and you are OK with that using the optional argument `na.rm=TRUE` (`na` = missing data & `rm` is *remove*).

```{r}
mean( df$Petal.Width, na.rm=TRUE)
```

To pass this to the `by()` function, we add the optional argument `na.rm=TRUE` and `by()` passes it along to the `mean` function as "..."

```{r}
by( df$Petal.Width, df$Species, mean, na.rm=TRUE )
```



]

---

# Creating a Data Frame

```{r}
library( tidyverse )
df <- tibble( Species = levels( iris$Species ), 
              Average = meanLength,
              Variance = varLength 
              )
df
```


---

# A Basic Table Using `kable`

```{r}
kable(df)
```

---

# Adding A Caption to the table

```{r}
irisTable <- kable( df, caption = "Mean and variance in sepal length for three iris species." )
irisTable
```

---

# Even Fancier Stuff with `kableExtras`

This library contains a bunch of additional helper functions that take a `kable` object and make it look better.

```{r}
library( kableExtra)
```

You must go check out [this](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) webpage (which is an RMarkdown page by the way) to see all the other ways you can fancy up your tables.
