# Numerical Data  

In `R`, numerical data is largely represented by a data type called `numeric`.   

--
- For most purposes, this is the only data type we will need (though `integer` types and specialized libraries exist).  



--
- Magnitude determined by your computer (my MacBook can handle `r format(.Machine$double.xmin)` - `r format(.Machine$double.xmax)`).  


---

# Operators

In many ways, `R` can act just like an interactive calculator.  *Arithmetic operators* are just like normal.

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- 10
y <- 23
x + y
x - y
x * y
x / y
```


---

# Exponential Operators

*Exponents* use the carat on the keyboard (on us-english keyboards it is above the #6 key). So the value of $2^16$ is 

```{r}
2^16
```

--

Roots are found by inverting the exponent.  For example, the $\;^3\sqrt{27}$ (cube-root of 27) is

```{r}
27^(1/3)
```

---

# Logrithms

The logrithms are provided as the function `log()` which defaults to the natural log

```{r}
log( 10 )
```

--

You can change the base by passing the function the optional argument (make sure you separate the value from the optional argument with a comma).

```{r}
log( 10, base=10 )
```

*Modulus Operator*

```{r}
23 %% 10 
```


---

# Order of Operations

The order of precedence for operations are just like you learned in math class. 

```{r}
x1 <- 23
y1 <- 55
x2 <- 56
y2 <- 63
distance <- sqrt(  (x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 )
distance
```

# Introspection & Coercion


---

# Introspection

In `R`, each variable can be queried about it's `class` (what kind of data that particular variable holds).  

```{r}
x <- 42
class( x )
```

--

You can also ask if it is a particular type using the `is.numeric()` function.

```{r}
is.numeric( x )
```


---

# Coercion 

We can also turn *one representation* of our data into a different different type, though there are limitations.  For example, if we just read in a text file and it has a represented as text (a [Character Data Type](../character_data/slides.html) in `R`) but we need to have it function as a `numeric` type, we can use the following approach

```{r}
x <- "42"
class( x )
```

--

The create a new variable who (if possible) contains the numeric representation of the character string `"42"`.
```{r}
y <- as.numeric( x )
class(y)
```

---

# Coercion Fail

When it fails, it returns a warning and a missing data value.

```{r}
as.numeric( "Bob" )
```

# Caveats

# Order of Operations

There are times that the order of operations will really come back to .red[bite you].  Consider this example where I create a sequence of numbers using the sequence operator (`:`)

```{r}
n <- 4
1:n
```

--

So if we wanted to make a sequence from 1 to $n-1$, we *could* type this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
1:n-1
```

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
1:n-1
```

---

To *fix* this, feel free to be *verbose* in your use of parentheses.  If you are intending to get $10^2$, $10^3$ $\ldots$ $10^6$ and type it as:

```{r}
10^2:6
```

--

What you want is:

```{r}
10^(2:6)
```


<div class="box-yellow">Notice how the second (and intended) code is actually easier to read than the first.</div>
---

# Numerical Approximations

Computers use binary switches to represent numbers.  For integers, it is great, but for floating point numbers it .red[sucks], big time.  

Consider the following:

```{r}
x <- .1
y <- .3 / 3 
```


But if we ask if they are equal, what do you expect?

--

```{r}
x == y
```

--

```{r}
print(x, digits=20)
print(y, digits=20)
```
