# The Recycling Rule

Operations on vectors that expect a particular length are handled (somewhat gracefully) using the 

<div class="box-green">*Recycling Rule*: The shorter of the two vectors will be stretched by reusing values from the start to equal the length of the larger vector.</div>

--

```{r}
x <- c(10,20,30)
y <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) 
x + y
```

--

If the shorter vector length is not a clean multiple of the larger one, it will issue a warning to let you know in case these dangling parts could cause problems.

```{r}
y <- 1:10
x + y
```
