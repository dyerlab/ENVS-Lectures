# What is the Structure of a Raster?

A Raster is simply a `matrix` of values with some additional decorations on it that allow it to have a spatial context.  

```{r}
values <- rpois( n = 36, lambda=12)
values
```

--

```{r}
x <- matrix( values, nrow=6)
x
```


---

# Spatial Designations

For each value in the `matrix`, when it is turned into a `raster` object: 

- The `cell` (pixel) has a defined spatial extent (width, height, & origin).

- All the physical space represented by that cell has *exactly the same value*

- The *courseness* of the raster is question dependent:

  - 3x5 matrix for Continental US may not adequately capture elevation trends.
  
  - 1m<sup>2</sup> matrix for elevation may be *a bit* too big.

---

# Matrix $\to$ Raster

```{r}
library( raster )
r <- raster( x )
r
```

--

Notice that when I plot it out, it does not show the data, but a summary of the data along with some key data about the contents, including:  
- A class definition  
- The dimensions of the underlying data matrix,  
- The resolution (e.g., the spatial extent of the sides of each pixel).  Since we have no CRS here, it is equal to $nrows(x)^{-1}$ and $ncols(x)^{-1}$.  
- The extent (the bounding box) and again since we do not have a CRS defined it just goes from $0$ to $1$.
- The `crs` (missing)
- The source can be either `memory` if the raster is not that big or `out of memory` if it is just referencing.


---

# Loading A Raster

By far, you will most commonly working with pre-existing raster data.  

- Several file formats including GeoTIFF, BIL, & ASC.
- All can be loaded from filesystem or internet with address.

```{r cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/raw/master/data/alt_22.tif"
r <- raster( url )
r
```

Notice that this raster has a defined CRS and as such it is projected and the extent relates to the units of the datum (e.g., from -120 to -90 degrees longitude and 0 to 30 degrees latitude).

# Built-in Plotting

Just like all things in `R`, `raster` objects can be visualized using built-in functions as well as functions from external libraries.

# Raster Sizes

These data only represent the elevation of the land.  Where there is water, the value in the underlying matrix is `NA`.  

Cell Type | Count 
----------|-------:
Land      | `r format( sum( !is.na( values(r) ) ), big.mark = "," )`  
Water     | `r format( sum( is.na( values(r) ) ), big.mark = "," )`

# Cropping

One of the first things to do is to crop the data down to represent the size and extent of our study area.  If we over 10 million missing data points (the ocean) and most of Mexico in this raster above but we are only working with sites in Baja California (Norte y Sur), we would do well to excise (or crop) the raster to only include the area we are interested in working with.  

--

Workflow:  

1. Define a bounding box (the spatial extent of the region of interest)  
2. Expand it a bit so that points are not **on the edges** of the box.
3. Create an `extent`
4. Crop the original matrix to represent the boundaries defined in the `extent`


---

# Cropping 1: Bounding Box

Let's use the beetle data from the [Spatial Points Lecture](https://dyerlab.github.io/ENVS-Lectures/spatial/spatial_points/slides.html#1) as the data we will be working with.  

```{r}
library( sf )
library( tidyverse )
beetle_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/Araptus_Disperal_Bias.csv"

read_csv( beetle_url ) %>% 
  st_as_sf( coords=c("Longitude","Latitude"), crs=4326 ) -> beetles

beetles %>% 
  st_bbox()
```

# Map Interactivity

You can work with raster data interactively (I just cannot do it here on this presentation because it has to be in real time).
