# Types of Quantification 

### General $\to$ Specific

- *Landscape Type* : The categories (e.g., `factor`) of landscape features present in the study area.

- *Landscape Composition* : The relative frequency of landscape features types in this area.

- *Landscape Configuration* : The spatial arrangement of landscape features on the earth.

# Organismal Perspective

We *must* remember that when we are looking at habitats, it is done so *only* from the perspective of the organism we are studying.  

- Temporal Scale

- Spatial Scale 

These are entirely .redinline[*independent*] of what our scales are or what the scale of the closest raster just happens to be.

# Quantifying Landscape Use

Besides .redinline[very tall ladders], our ability to map out the characteristics of specific regions on the planet are dictated by the availability of raster databases.

# Raster Sources


.pull-left[
The MRLC provides an interactive mapping tool to provide access to locations.  Base rasters are available but are .redinline[HUGE] (e.g, 25Gb and larger) and you'd be doing a lot of 

*download $\to$ open in R $\to$ define boundary box $\to$ crop $\to$ save* 

IF (and this is a big if), you laptop does not crumble due to size of the data sets first...

Consequently, the use of the interactive viewer at  

https://www.mrlc.gov/viewer/ 

is a great resources.

MRLC Data comes as a set of GEOTiff objects, which I've uploaded to the class GitHub account.

```{r}
library( raster )

You can use the normal `plot()` function (but for some reason it produces an extraneous empty plot for this one) or use our old friend `ggplot2()`.

# Make It Usable

For *historical* reasons, much of the data that we work with is defined using numeric codes needing *look-up tables* to format into output that can be interpreted by humans.  When you download the raw data, it provides a [CSV file legend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/NLCD_landcover_legend_2018_12_17_qn2B1f8ganicJNKnJN0e.csv) to translate these numbers into real-world feature names.

```{r eval=FALSE}
legend_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/NLCD_landcover_legend_2018_12_17_qn2B1f8ganicJNKnJN0e.csv"

# Level 3 - Spatial Configuration

There are *a lot* more metrics that we can estimate from landscape features than just identity and frequency and what we will be covering here is just a bit off the top.  We can loosely categorize the kinds of metrics into the following groups:  

- Aggregation metrics  
- Area & Edge metrics  
- Contrast metrics  
- Core area metrics  
- Diversity metrics  
- Isolation metrics  
- Shape metrics  
- Subdivision metrics


---

# Landscape Metrics Package

```{r}
library( landscapemetrics )
```

There are some requirements for your raster to use this library:  

1. The distance units of your projection are meter, as the package converts units internally and returns results in either meters, square meters or hectares. For more information see the help file of each function.  

2. Your raster encodes landscape classes as integers (1, 2, 3, 4, …, n).  

3. Landscape metrics describe categorical landscapes, that means that your landscape needs to be classified (we throw a warning if you have more than 30 classes to make sure you work with a classified landscape).  


---

# Built-In Checks

To check the applicability of your raster, there are some helper functions that provide feedback to you.

```{r}
check_landscape( landscapemetrics::podlasie_ccilc )
```


--

&nbsp;

Fortunately, this package was written with the MRLC data sets.


```{r}
check_landscape( land_2016 )
```


---
# Nested Levels of Metrics

This library breaks up the functions into the following nested levels: class, patch, landscape

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="500"}
list_lsm() %>% datatable( rownames=FALSE, filter = "none", options = list(dom="tip",searchable = F, ordering = F, pageLength=7) )
```

---

# Landscape Metric Naming Conventions

The functions in this library are named with the following taxonomy.

`lsm_{l|p|c}_metric()`

where `{l|p|c}` is one of `l`, `p`, or `c` and the metric is the name as shown above.  So, for example, if we are looking at the area of each patch in the landscape we would use the function

--

.pull-left[

```{r}
lsm_p_area( land_2016 ) 
```

]

.pull-right[
The output provides the following components:  

- layers: See `?stack` for raster stacks  

- level: The nested level of the analysis (lpc)  

- class: The landscape feature class from the raster

- id: A unique identification number for each group

- metric: What is being measured.

- value: The estimated value for the analysis.

# Other Metrics of Interest

- *gyrate* - The mean distance between cells within it which approximates something like the average distance an organism can move within a patch before encountering a boundary.  

- *ca* - The physical area associated with each landscape type.


- *clump* - A measure of how spatially contingent the features are ranging from random (no clumping) to all in one large patch (fully clumped).

- *pr* - Patch richness.

- *shdi* - Shannon's Diversity index
