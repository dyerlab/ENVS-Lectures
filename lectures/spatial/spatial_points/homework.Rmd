This *in-class activity* has two purposes:

1. To make sure everyone can get their computer up-to-date with the proper set of libraries so that we can work with geospatial data, and
2. Give you some practice turning normal numerical data into geospatial coordiantes and performing basic opertions.

## Spatial Libraries

The following code goes through the necessary libraries and checks to see if they are installed.  The `require()` function is just like `library()` except that it returns `TRUE/FALSE` if your computer does or does not have the library already installed.  I use the `if(){}` conditional to default install the library if it is not installed (e.g., `!require()` evaluates to `TRUE`).

```{r}

needed_libraries <- c("sf",
                      "maps",
                      "units",
                      "rgdal",
                      "rgeos",
                      "GGally",
                      "mapproj",
                      "leaflet",
                      "rnaturalearth",
                      "rnaturalearthdata"
                      )

for( lib in needed_libraries ) {
  if( !require( lib, ) ) {
    install.packages( lib )
  }
}




```
