For this activity, we will focus on loading and manipulating `LINESTRING` and `POLYGON` objects derived from the City of Richmond, GIS Department.

Here are the URL's for the shapefile zip archives.

```{r}
roads_url <- "https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/raw/master/data/Centerlines-shp.zip"
district_url <- "https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/raw/master/data/Zoning_Districts-shp.zip"
schools_url <- "https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/raw/master/data/rps_schools.zip"
```

And here is the CSV file for describing Zoning Types.

```{r}
zone_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/DistrictCodes.csv"
```
