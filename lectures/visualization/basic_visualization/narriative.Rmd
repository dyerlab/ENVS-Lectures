## The Data

The `iris` flower data set (also known as *Fisher's Iris data set*) is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) in his [1936](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x) paper entitled, *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis*.

These data are part of the base `R` distribution and contain sepal and pedal measurements for three species if congeneric plants, *Iris setosa*, *I. versicolor*, and *I. virginica*.

Here is what the data summary looks like.

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

## Basic Plotting in R

The base `R` comes with several built-in plotting functions, each of which is accessed through a single function with a wide array of optional arguments that modify the overall appearance.


*Histograms - The Density of A Single Data Vector*

```{r}
hist( iris$Sepal.Length)
```

You can see that the default values for the `hist()` function label the x-axis & title on the graph have the names of the variable passed to it, with a y-axis is set to "Frequency".

- `xlab` & `ylab`: The names attached to both x- and y-axes.
- `main`: The title on top of the graph.
- `breaks`: This controls the way in which the original data are partitioned (e.g., the width of the bars along the x-axis).   
   - If you pass a single number, `n` to this option, the data will be partitioned into `n` bins.
   - If you pass a sequence of values to this, it will use this sequence as the boundaries of bins.
- `col`: The color of the bar (not the border)
- `probability`: A flag as either `TRUE` or `FALSE` (the default) to have the y-axis scaled by total likelihood of each bins rather than a count of the numbrer of elements in that range.



*Density - Estimating the continuous density of data*

```{r}
d_sepal.length <- density( iris$Sepal.Length )
d_sepal.length
```

The `density()` function estimates a continuous probability density function  for the data and returns an object that has both `x` and `y` values.  In fact, it is a special kind of object.

```{r}
class(d_sepal.length)
```

Because of this, the general `plot()` function knows how to plot these kinds of things.

```{r}
plot( d_sepal.length )
```

Now, the general `plot()` function has *A TON* of options and is overloaded to be able to plot all kinds of data.  In addition to `xlab` and `ylab`, we modify the following:

- `col`: Color of the line.
- `lwd`: Line width
- `bty`: This covers the 'box type', which is the square box around the plot area.  I typically use `bty="n"` because I hate those square boxes around my plots (compare the following 2 plots to see the differences).  But you do you.
- `xlim` & `ylim`: These dictate the range on both the x- and y-axes.  It takes a pair of values such as `c(min,max)` and then limits (or extends) that axis to to fill that range.


*Scatter Plots - Plotting two variables*

```{r}
plot( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width  )
```

Here is the most general `plot()`.  The form of the arguments to this function are x-data and then y-data.  The visual representation of the data is determined by the optional values you pass (or if you do not pass any optional values, the default is the scatter plot shown above) 


Parameter | Description
----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`type`    | The kind of plot to show ('p'oint, 'l'ine, 'b'oth, or 'o'ver).  A point plot is the default.
`pch`     | The character (or symbol) being used to plot.  There 26 recognized general characters to use for plotting.  The default is `pch=1`. 
`col`     | The color of the symbols/lines that are plot.
`cex`     | The magnification size of the character being plot.  The default is `cex=1` and deviation from that will increase ($cex > 1$) or decrease ($0 < cex < 1$) the scaling of the symbols.  
`lwd`     | The width of any lines in the plot.
`lty`     | The type of line to be plot (solid, dashed, etc.)

```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mar=c(3,3,3,3))
num <- 0 ; 
num1 <- 0
plot(0,0 , xlim=c(0,21) , ylim=c(0.5,6.5), col="white" , yaxt="n" , ylab="" , xlab="", bty="n")

for (i in seq(1,20)){
   points(i,1 , pch=i , cex=3)
   points(i,2 , col=i , pch=16 , cex=3)
   points(i,3 , col="black" , pch=16 , cex=i*0.25)
   if(i %in% c(seq(1,18,3))){
      num=num+1
      points(c(i,i+2), c(4,4) , col="black" , lty=num , type="l" , lwd=2)
      text(i+1.1 , 4.25 , num)
   }
   
   if(i %in% c(seq(1,20,5))){
      num1=num1+1
      points(c(i,i+1,i+2,i+3), c(5,5,5,5) , col="black"  , type=c("p","l","b","o")[num1] , lwd=2)
      text(i+1.5 , 5.3 , c("p","l","b","o")[num1] )
      points(c(i,i+1,i+2,i+3), c(6,6,6,6) , col="black"  , type="l",  lwd=num1)
      text(i+1.5 , 6.25 , num1 )
      
   }
}

axis(2, at = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 
     labels = c("pch" , "col" , "cex" , "lty", "type" , "lwd" ), 
     tick = TRUE, 
     col = "black", 
     las = 1 )
```

One of the relevant things you can use the parameter `pch` for is to differentiate between groups of observations (such as different species for example).  Instead of giving it one value, pass it a vector of values whose length is equal to that for x- and y-axis data.  

Here is an example where I coerce the `iris$Species` data vector into numeric types and use that for symbols.

```{r warning=FALSE}
symbol <- as.numeric(iris$Species)
symbol
```

```{r}
plot( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, pch=symbol )
```

We can use the same technique to use `col` instead of `pch`.  Here I make a vector of color names and then use the previously defined in the variable `symbol`.

```{r}
raw_colors <- c("red","gold","forestgreen")
colors <- raw_colors[ symbol ]
colors
```

In addition to the general form for the function `plot(x,y)` we used above, we can use an alternative designation based upon what is called the *functional form*.  The *functional form* is how we designate functions in `R`, such as regression anlaysis.  This basic syntax for this is `y ~ x`, that is the response variable (on the y-axis) is a function of the predictor (on the x-axis).

For simplicty, I'll make `x` and `y` varibles pointing to the same same data as in the previous graph.

```{r}
y <- iris$Sepal.Width
x <- iris$Sepal.Length
```

Then, the `plot()` function can be written as (including all the fancy additional stuff we just described):  

```{r}
plot( y ~ x , 
      col=colors, 
      pch=20, 
      bty="n", 
      xlab="Sepal Length", ylab="Sepal Width")
```

This is **much** easier to read (also notice how I used serveral lines to put in all the options to the plot function for legibility).

*Bar Plots - Quantifying Counts*

The `barplot` function takes a set of heights, one for each bar.  Let's quickly grab the mean length for sepals across all three species.  There are many ways to do this, here are two, the first being more pedantic and the second more concise.

The `iris` data is in a `data.frame` that has a column designating the species. We can see which ones using `unique()`.

```{r}
unique( iris$Species )
```

To estimate the mean for each species, we can take values in `iris$Sepal.Length` for each level of `iris$Species` using indices.

```{r}
mu.Setosa <- mean( iris$Sepal.Length[ iris$Species == "setosa" ])
mu.Versicolor <- mean( iris$Sepal.Length[ iris$Species == "versicolor" ])
mu.Virginica <- mean( iris$Sepal.Length[ iris$Species == "virginica" ])

meanSepalLength <- c( mu.Setosa, mu.Versicolor, mu.Virginica )
meanSepalLength
```

When we plot these data using `barplot()` we pass the values and set the names of the bars us

```{r}
barplot( meanSepalLength, 
         names.arg = c("setosa","versicolor","virginica"), 
         xlab="Iris Species",
         ylab="Mean Sepal Length")
```


The second way to do this is to use the `by()` function (see `?by` for the complete help file).  The `by` function takes the following objects:  

- The raw data to use as measurements.  Here we will use `iris$Sepal.Length` as the raw data.
- Data designating groups to partition the raw data into (we will use `iris$Species`).
- The function that you want to use on each group. (here we will ask for the mean).

```{r}
meanSepalLength <- by( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean )
meanSepalLength
```

The data returned from this function is both `numeric` *and* has a name set for each value. 
```{r}
is.numeric( meanSepalLength )
names( meanSepalLength )
```


Then when we pass that to `barplot()` the column labels are set automatically (e.g., no need to set `names.arg` as above).

```{r}
barplot( meanSepalLength, 
         xlab = "Iris Species",
         ylab = "Average Sepal Length")
```


*Boxplots - High density information*


A boxplot contains a high amount of information content and is appropriate when the groupings on the x-axis are categorical.  For each category, the graphical representation includes:  

- The median value for the raw data
- A box indicating the area between the first and third quartile (e.g,. the values enclosing the 25% - 75% of the data).  The top and bottoms are often referred to as the *hinges* of the box.
- A notch (if requested), represents confidence around the estimate of the median.
- Whiskers extending out to shows $\pm 1.5 * IQR$ (the Inner Quartile Range)
- Any points of the data that extend beyond the whiskers are plot as points.

For legibility, we can use the *functional* form for the plots as well as separate out the `data.frame` from the columns using the optional `data=` argument.

```{r}
boxplot( Sepal.Length ~ Species, 
         data = iris, 
         notch=TRUE, 
         ylab="Sepal Length" )
```


## Colors 


*Named Colors - * There are `r length( colors() )` pre-defined, named colors built into the base `R` distribution.  Here is a random selection of those values.

```{r}
randomColors <- sample( colors(), size = nrow(iris) )
head(randomColors)
```

To use these colors, you can specify them by name for either all the elements 

```{r}
boxplot( Sepal.Length ~ Species, 
         data = iris, 
         col = randomColors[1],
         notch=TRUE, 
         ylab="Sepal Length" )
```

*or* for each element individually.

```{r}
boxplot( Sepal.Length ~ Species, 
         data = iris, 
         col = randomColors[1:3],
         notch=TRUE, 
         ylab="Sepal Length" )
```

*Hex Colors: *  You can also use hexadecimal representations of colors, which is most commonly used on the internet.  A hex representation of colors consists of red, green, and blue values encoded as numbers in base 16 (e.g., the single digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F).  There are a lot of great resources on the internet for color themes that report red, green, blue and hex values.  I often use the [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) website to look for themes that go well together for slides or presentations.  


*Color Brewer* Finally, there is an interesting website at [colorbrewer2.org](https://colorbrewer2.org) that has some interesting built-in palettes.  There is an associated library that makes creating palettes for plots really easy and as you get more expreienced with `R`, you will find this very helpful.  For quick visualizations and estimation of built-in color palettes, you can look at the [website](https://colorbrewer2.org) (below).

![ColorBrewer Site](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50174527901_ae29c0e624_c_d.jpg)
or look at the colors in `R`

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all()
```

There are three basic kinds of palettes: divergent, qualitative, and sequential.  Each of these built-in palletes has a maximum number of colors available (though as you see below we can use them to interpolate larger sets) as well as indications if the palette is safe for colorblind individuals.

```{r}
brewer.pal.info
```

It is very helpful to look at the different kinds of data palettes available and I'll show you how to use them below when we color in the states based upon population size at the end of this document.

## Annotations

You can easily add text onto a graph using the `text()` function.  Here is the correlation between the sepal length and width (the function `cor.test()` does the statistical test).

```{r}
cor <- cor.test( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width )
cor
```

We can put the correlation and the p-value on the plot

```{r}
cor.text <- paste( "r = ", format( cor$estimate, digits=4), "; P = ", format( cor$p.value, digits=4 ), sep="" ) 
cor.text
```

The we can the overlay this onto an existing plot.  For the `text()` function, we need to give the x- and y- coordinates where you want it put onto the coordinate space of the existing graph.

```{r}
plot( y ~ x , 
      col=colors, 
      pch=20, 
      bty="n", 
      xlab="Sepal Length", ylab="Sepal Width")
text( 7.4, 4.2, cor.text )
```



## Maps

There are many several different mapping components, here are a few examples.

*Choropleth Map - regional colors*

A choropleth map displays divided geographic regions that are colored in relation to some numerical value.  The `maps` library provides some basic maps for you to do some quick visualization.  Here is a map of the continental US.  

```{r}
library(maps)
map('state', projection = "polyconic" )
```


I grabbed some census data from the US Census site for each state and saved it as a CSV file.  It is currently hosted on a Github site I use for all my ENVS teaching and we can read it directly from Github using the URL.

```{r}
library(readr)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/lectures/visualization/basic_visualization/states.csv"
sz <- read_csv( url )
head(sz)
```
In this data set, there are 48 states (Hawaii & Alaska are not there) and the District of Columbia.  To color these, I'm going to use a color palette defined in the `RColorBrewer` library that goes from yellow to orange to red.  This is a sequential color ramp (see  `brewer.pal.info` for other palettes).

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
colors <- brewer.pal(9,"YlOrRd")
colors
```

Then I'm going stretch these colors out from 9 distinct colors to 49 colors, one for each State and D.C.

```{r}
colors <- colorRampPalette( colors )(49)
colors
```





```{r}
groups <- cut( sz$population, 48 )
sz$colors <- colors[ groups ]
head(sz)
```

```{r}
map( 'state', 
     col=sz$colors, 
     fill=TRUE, 
     projection="polyconic")
```
