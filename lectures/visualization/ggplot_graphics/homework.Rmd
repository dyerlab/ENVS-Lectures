# The Data

For this homework we will be working with the data that were used in the lecture on `ggplot` from the 2011 *The Economist* article looking at the relationship between human development and perceived corruption.

![*Figure 1:* The relationship between the perception of corruption and the human development index from 2011 for 174 nations states.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50294412713_25bbd52230_c_d.jpg)

The data are located on the [class GitHub site](https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures) and can be accessed by the following URL, which is being presented as a CSV file.

```{r}
# The URL for the data on GitHub
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/EconomistData.csv"
```

Use the URL above and load the data into R and present a summary.  Name this data frame `df` because some code below that I give assumes that name.

```{r}
## Load the data here.
library( readr )

df <- read_csv( url )
```

As it stands, we are going to need to turn the `Region` column from a raw `character` type to a `factor` data type.  To to this, we can use the function `as.factor()` and assign it back to the `data.frame`.


```{r}
# Turn Region into factor

df$Region <- as.factor( df$Region  )
```


*In all the plot on this homework, you must make an legend when appropriate and label the axes properly.*


# Univariate Data

For this section, focus on histograms and density plots.  Create a historgram plot and a density plot, one for built-in graphics and the other using `ggplot`.  Feel free to embellish them as you please but you **must** have properly labeled axes.

```{r}
# Built-in hist for HDI
meanHDI <- by( df$HDI, df$Region, mean)
barplot( meanHDI )



```

```{r}
# Density plot for HDI using built-in graphics

```

Now for CPI, do the same things using `ggplot` graphics.  You must first load in the `ggplot` library.

```{r}
# Load in GGPlot library
library( ggplot2 )
```

Then make the plots

```{r}
# GGPlot histogram
```

```{r}
# GGPlot density Plot
```

```{r}
# Overlay density on top of histogram using ggplot
```


# Categorical Data

For data that has both categorical data and continuous data, we can display the data in several different ways.  

## Bar Plots 

For standard bar plots, we will create a new `data.frame` that has average values for the continuous variable across each of the levels of the categorical variable.  You can do this manually or by using the `by()` function.  If you use `by()` you'll need to coerce it into a numeric data vector via `as.numeric()`.  If you need a reminder of this, check out [this slide](https://dyerlab.github.io/ENVS-Lectures/visualization/basic_visualization/slides.html#51).

```{r}
# Create new data.frame with averages for HDI by Region
```

Create a barplot using built-in graphics.

```{r}
# barplot
```

GGPlot has several ways to look at these kinds of data.  There is a [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) for a bunch of `ggplot` functions in Canvas (as well as GitHub from that link).  

To create a bar plot in `ggplot` one can use the `geom_col()` geometric layer.  

```{r}
# geom_col plot
```

That plot looks great but the x-axis labels are all screwed up.  To fix this you can add some customization to the theme by changing the text elements on the x axis.  The code in the chunk below, when added to your plot code, will rotate the angle of the text by 45° and justified.  Add your code to this chunk and see how this changes the axis labels (feel free to play around with them).  

Note: You *must* change `eval=FALSE` to `eval=TRUE` to get this chunck to work.  I had to set it to not run because the text `{YOUR PLOT CODE HERE}` will not compile.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Fix the axes
{YOUR PLOT CODE HERE} + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
```

## Box plots & others

A Boxplot needs all the data to be able to display the distribution of values, so we'll be using the whole data frame again.

```{r}
# boxplot of HDI by Region using built-in graphics.
```

Now the same using `ggplot`.

```{r}
# GGPlot geom_boxplot
```

The `ggplot` library has additional ways to visualize these kinds of data. Look at the CheatSheet if you need assistance or the built-in help file for `geom_violin` to make this plot.



```{r}
# Look up geom_violin and use that for plotting
```

### Adding Colors

Take the violin plot above and color each region in a different color.  

```{r}
# Colored violins
```


# Continuous Bivariate Data

Using the built-in `plot()` function create the following scatter plots. The plot characters and other customization are found on [this slide](https://dyerlab.github.io/ENVS-Lectures/visualization/basic_visualization/slides.html#28) from the lecture on built-in graphics.


```{r}
# HDI as a function of CPI with Regions defined by plot character  + legend
```

Use whatever color scheme you like.

```{r}
# HDI as a function of CPI with Regions defined by color + legend
```

Now do the same with `ggplot` using regions as either plot character or color.

```{r}
# HDI as function of CPI with Region differences.
```



# Labels

OK, so the last thing we are going to do is define a separate `data.frame` that has just the labels so we can make it look a bit like the original plot.  To do this, I define a new data.frame with just the countries that I'm interested in plotting.

```{r}
Country <- c("Russia", "Venezuela", "Iraq", "Myanmar", "Sudan",
             "Afghanistan", "Congo", "Greece", "Argentina", "Brazil", 
             "India", "Italy", "China", "South Africa", "Spane", 
             "Botswana", "Cape Verde", "Bhutan", "Rwanda", "France", 
             "United States", "Germany", "Britain", "Barbados", "Norway", 
             "Japan","New Zealand", "Singapore")
df.labels <- data.frame( Country )
```

Next, I take this new data.frame and the original one and use the `merge()` function.

![*Figure 2:* Help file for `merge()`.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50348700586_c9ee681494_c_d.jpg)

What this function *requires* is that the two data.frames **must** have a colum with the same name.  In this case, both the original data.frame had one named `Country` as did the new one.  I'm assuming that the original data was loaded in as the variable `df` as requested above—if you named it something else, then replace your variable name with the `df` in the first line of the code below.

```{r}
df.labels <- merge( df.labels, df)
df.labels
```


Now, let's load in the `ggrepel` library[^1] and use both of these data.frames to add labels to a scatter plot.  To do this, you'll have to use the full data frame to lay down a `geom_point()` layer and then add the `geom_text_repel()` layer using the other `df.labels` data.frame. To make it look right, you may need to futz around with the various data mappings in the `aes` functions.  See [this slide](https://dyerlab.github.io/ENVS-Lectures/visualization/ggplot_graphics/slides.html#62) for a refresher on what `ggrepel` needs to do its job.

```{r}
# GGRepel 
library( ggrepel )
```








[^1]: If you get an error when trying to load in the ggrepel library saying it could not find the library, then install it using `install.packages("ggrepel")`.
