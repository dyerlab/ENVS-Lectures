# The Data

For this homework we will be working with the data that were used in the lecture on `ggplot` from the 2011 *The Economist* article looking at the relationship between human development and perceived corruption.

![*Figure 1:* The relationship between the perception of corruption and the human development index from 2011 for 174 nations states.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50294412713_25bbd52230_c_d.jpg)

The data are located on the [class GitHub site](https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures) and can be accessed by the following URL, which is being presented as a CSV file.

```{r}
# The URL for the data on GitHub
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/EconomistData.csv"
```

Use the URL above and load the data into R and present a summary.  Name this data frame `df` because some code below that I give assumes that name.

```{r}
## Load the data here.
library(readr)
df <- read_csv(url)
```

As it stands, we are going to need to turn the `Region` column from a raw `character` type to a `factor` data type.  To to this, we can use the function `as.factor()` and assign it back to the `data.frame`.


```{r}
# Turn Region into factor
df$Region <- as.factor( df$Region )
summary( df )
```

# Univariate Data

For this section, focus on histograms and density plots.  Create a historgram plot and a density plot, one for built-in graphics and the other using `ggplot`.  Feel free to embellish them as you please but you **must** have properly labeled axes.

```{r}
# Built-in hist for HDI
hist( df$HDI, probability = TRUE  )
```
```{r}
# Density plot for HDI using built-in graphics
plot( density(df$HDI))
```

Now for CPI, do the same things using `ggplot` graphics.

```{r}
# GGPlot histogram
library( ggplot2 )
ggplot( df, aes(x=CPI) ) + 
  geom_histogram( bins=45) + 
  xlab("Corruption Perception Index") + 
  ylab("Frequency")
```

```{r}
# GGPlot density Plot
ggplot( df, aes(x=CPI) ) + 
  geom_density() + 
  xlab("Corruption Perception Index") + 
  ylab("Frequency")
```

```{r}
# Overlay density on top of histogram using ggplot
ggplot( df, aes(x=CPI) ) + 
  geom_histogram( bins=45, aes( y = ..density..)) +
  geom_density( color="red", size=2) +
  xlab("Corruption Perception Index") + 
  ylab("Frequency")
```


# Categorical Data

For data that has both categorical data and continuous data, we can display the data in several different ways.  

## Bar Plots 

For standard bar plots, we will create a new `data.frame` that has average values for the continuous variable across each of the levels of the categorical variable.  You can do this manually or by using the `by()` function.  If you use `by()` you'll need to coerce it into a numeric data vector via `as.numeric()`.

```{r}
# Create new data.frame with averages for HDI by Region
HDI <- as.numeric( by( df$HDI, df$Region, mean, simplify=TRUE) )
df1 <- data.frame( HDI, Region = levels( df$Region) )
summary( df1 )
```

Create a barplot using built-in graphics.

```{r}
barplot( df1$HDI, names.arg=df1$Region, xlab="Region", ylab="Human Development Index" )
```

GGPlot has several ways to look at these kinds of data.  There is a [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) for a bunch of `ggplot` functions in Canvas (as well as GitHub from that link).  

To create a bar plot in `ggplot` one can use the `geom_col()` geometric layer.  

```{r}
ggplot( df1, aes(x=Region,y=HDI) ) + geom_col()
```

That plot looks great but the x-axis labels are all screwed up.  To fix this you can add some customization to the theme by changing the text elements on the x axis.  The code in the chunk below, when added to your plot code, will rotate the angle of the text by 45° and justified.  Add your code to this chunk and see how this changes the axis labels (feel free to play around with them).

```{r eval=FALSE}
{YOUR PLOT CODE HERE} + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
```

## Box plots & others

A Boxplot needs all the data to be able to display the distribution of values, so we'll be using the whole data frame again.

```{r}
# boxplot of HDI by Region using built-in graphics.
boxplot( HDI ~ Region, data=df, notch=TRUE)
```

Now the same using `ggplot`.

```{r}
# GGPlot geom_boxplot
ggplot( df, aes(Region,HDI) ) + 
  geom_boxplot( notch=TRUE ) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
```

The `ggplot` library has additional ways to visualize these kinds of data. Look at the CheatSheet if you need assistance or the built-in help file for `geom_violin` to make this plot.



```{r}
# Look up geom_violin and use that for plotting
ggplot( df, aes(Region,HDI) ) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
```

### Adding Colors

Take the violin plot above and color each region in a different color.  

```{r}
ggplot( df, aes(Region,HDI, fill=Region) ) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
```


# Continuous Bivariate Data

Using the built-in `plot()` function create the following scatter plots.  *Make sure to include a legend.*


```{r}
# HDI as a function of CPI with Regions defined by plot character
plot( HDI ~ CPI, data=df, pch=as.numeric(Region))
legend( 6.5,0.6, legend=levels(df$Region), pch=as.numeric( df$Region) , bty="n")
```


```{r}
# HDI as a function of CPI with Regions defined by color
plot( HDI ~ CPI, data=df, col=as.numeric(Region))
legend( 6.5,0.6, legend=levels(df$Region), col=as.numeric( df$Region), pch=1, bty="n")
```

Now do the same with `ggplot` using regions as either plot character or color.

```{r}
# HDI as function of CPI with Region differences.
ggplot( df, aes(CPI,HDI, color=Region) ) + geom_point() 
```



# Labels

OK, so the last thing we are going to do is define a separate `data.frame` that has just the labels so we can make it look a bit like the original plot.  To do this, I define a new data.frame with just the countries that I'm interested in plotting.

```{r}
df.labels <- data.frame( Country = c("Russia", "Venezuela", "Iraq", "Myanmar", "Sudan",
                                     "Afghanistan", "Congo", "Greece", "Argentina", "Brazil",
                                     "India", "Italy", "China", "South Africa", "Spane",
                                     "Botswana", "Cape Verde", "Bhutan", "Rwanda", "France",
                                     "United States", "Germany", "Britain", "Barbados", "Norway", 
                                     "Japan","New Zealand", "Singapore") 
)
```

Next, I take this new data.frame and the original one and use the `merge()` function.

![*Figure 2:* Help file for `merge()`.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50348700586_c9ee681494_c_d.jpg)

What this function *requires* is that the two data.frames **must** have a colum with the same name.  In this case, both the original data.frame had one named `Country` as did the new one.  I'm assuming that the original data was loaded in as the variable `df` as requested above—if you named it something else, then replace your variable name with the `df` in the first line of the code below.

```{r}
df.labels <- merge( df.labels, df)
df.labels
```


Now, let's load in the `ggrepel` library[^1] and use both of these data.frames to add labels to a scatter plot.  To do this, you'll have to use the full data frame to lay down a `geom_point()` layer and then add the `geom_text_repel()` layer using the other `df.labels` data.frame. To make it look right, you may need to futz around with the various data mappings in the `aes` functions.

```{r}
library( ggrepel )
ggplot(df, aes(CPI, HDI) ) + 
  geom_point( pch=1, aes(color=Region) ) + 
  geom_text_repel( aes(label=Country), data=df.labels)
```
